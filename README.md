# Real-time Avalon game
The Avalon board game Single Page App implementation.

### Motivation
Avalon is a social/strategy board game we play as part of team building.
It would be cool to build a real-time web app which allows remote team members to join the game.

This small project leverages React, Socket.io, Express and Node.js to deliver real-time multiplayer gaming experience.
